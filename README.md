## Description

Disaster relief is designed to allow people affected by a natural disaster to ask for help. It also allows other users to give help. Posts on the site are referred to as "campaigns".

Users can view campaigns without having to login but are required to do so should they wish to respond to or start an individual campaign.

The site uses Google maps API (Geolib and Autocomplete) to calculate distances between users.

Filter, search and sort functions enable users to refine the results by location, distance and keywords.

## Approach

We pair coded major tasks and smaller features were completed individually in order to save time. Merges were done daily and bug fixing sessions were pair coded. Small bugs were fixed as and when they arose. Trello was used to manage specific tasks being split into backlog (desirable), backlog (essential), in progress, waiting to merge and merged.
